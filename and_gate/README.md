***HOW  TO  RUN***

1.  Have Questasim  Installed.
2.  Install VScode
3.  (Optional)  Install the UVM Extension for VScode.
4.  Close VScode.
5.  Press 'Win + r'
6.  Type in 'wt'
7.  If nothing found then open microsoft store and install 'windows terminal' (Terminal is missing hence need to install)
8.  When windows terminal has opened, navigate to the directory where you want to have your project in the terminal. : cd .\Documents\UVM\... as per your requirement
9.  when you reached the folder, create a new folder and give it your project name :  make new folder using mkdir <project_name>
10.  Go inside this project folder from the terminal using the cd command :    cd <project_name>
11.  This is where all your project files will be created and saved.
12.  now type in the terminal :   code .      (this will open vscode from that following directory)
13.  This will make the vscode's terminal open in that directory
14.  Once vscode is open, press  ctrl + `  to open the terminal in vscode platform.
15.  The VSCode terminal will be open and henceforth we will be using this vscode terminal, you may close the windows terminal in the background.
16.  Now all the commands from here are supposed to be typed in the VScode terminal
17.  Type in terminal  vlib  <name_you_want_to_give_to_your_work_library>      (this is necessary, recommended to give the name of your project i.e. <and_gate_lib>)
18.  This will make the work library alias as and_gate_lib  as per questa's requirements.
19.  now if you have the design and sim files just copy it from the windows gui into this project folder (not the library folder, just outside it)
